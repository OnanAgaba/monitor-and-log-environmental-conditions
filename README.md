## 1. Introduction

Environmental monitoring is critical for assessing hydrological, meteorological, and ecological trends. This project presents a low-cost system using open-source hardware to monitor temperature, relative humidity (RH), and carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) over three days in a caravan.

## 2. Experimental Design

### 2.1 Wiring and Assembly

Components include an Arduino UNO, SHTC3 sensor (for T/RH), SCD-40 sensor (for COâ‚‚/T/RH), and microSD storage. Sensors and storage were connected via jumper wires and STEMMA QT cables.

### 2.2 Programming and Logging

The Arduino was programmed using Arduino IDE to log measurements every 10 seconds. Data was timestamped and saved to a microSD card.

| MicroSD Module     | SD card interface                          | $5.95  |
| SD Card            | Data storage                               | $15.00 |
| SHTC3 Sensor       | Temp and RH sensor                         | $6.95  |
| SCD-40 Sensor      | COâ‚‚, Temp, RH sensor                       | $44.95 |
| Cables             | USB and jumper wires                       | $6.98  |

### 2.4 System Overview

The system continuously logs T, RH, and COâ‚‚ indoors using connected sensors and Arduino.

## 3. Results

- Logging began on May 14, 2025.
- COâ‚‚ levels increased during periods of occupancy.
- Both sensors agreed on temperature trends; RH values varied.
- SHTC3 showed consistently higher RH than SCD-40.
