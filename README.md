1. Overview
-----------
This project demonstrates how to monitor indoor environmental conditions‚Äîtemperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)‚Äîusing low-cost open-source hardware over a 3-day period.

2. System Components
---------------------
- Microcontroller: Arduino UNO  
- Sensors: SHTC3 (T/RH), SCD-40 (CO‚ÇÇ/T/RH)  
- Storage: microSD card via breakout module

3. Wiring & Assembly
---------------------
Sensors and storage were wired to the Arduino via jumper wires and a STEMMA QT cable. Powered via USB, the setup logged real-time sensor data.

4. Programming & Data Logging
------------------------------
Using Arduino IDE v2.3.4, the code (C++) logged sensor values every 10 seconds using `millis()` for timestamps. Data was saved to a microSD card for offline analysis.

5. Bill of Materials
---------------------
| Component       | Description           | Cost    |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Arduino UNO     | Microcontroller       | $12.90  |
| SHTC3 Sensor    | T/RH Sensor (I2C)     | $6.95   |
| SCD-40 Sensor   | CO‚ÇÇ/T/RH Sensor (I2C) | $44.95  |
| microSD Module  | SD card interface     | $5.95   |
| SD Card         | SanDisk Ultra HC1     | $15.00  |
| Cables          | Jumper wires & USB    | $6.98   |

6. Results
----------
Measurements began on May 14, 2025 at 22:00, and ran for three days.  
- CO‚ÇÇ levels spiked during occupancy  
- T readings were consistent across sensors  
- RH values varied: SHTC3 reported higher values than SCD-40

7. Conclusion
--------------
This setup shows that affordable, scalable, open-source tools can effectively support indoor environmental monitoring. Future improvements could include:
- Real-Time Clock (RTC)
- Wireless data transfer
- Sensor calibration
